# Crumble

**WINDOWS ONLY**
I tested this on Visual Studio Code 2019, I am positive that it will work with other IDE's however I am unsure if your new file will save on your IDE's repo directory or somewhere else.

Summary:
Program using while-loop that will run through a wordlist from a given file 
and that will delete words based on its character length that the user sets it to.


Instructions:
Launch CPP file
**Once prompt open**
Input length of character you want to delete
Add the wordlist (preferably drag and drop)
Enter a name of your new wordlist
The file should be saved on your repos for the VScode
